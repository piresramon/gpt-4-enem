## Introduction

This repository contains code and data used in the paper "[Evaluating GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 Models on Brazilian University Admission Exams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17003)". The study explores the capabilities of Language Models (LMs) in solving high-stakes multiple-choice tests, using the *[Exame Nacional do Ensino Médio (ENEM)](https://www.gov.br/inep/pt-br/areas-de-atuacao/avaliacao-e-exames-educacionais/enem)* as a case study. The ENEM is a multidisciplinary entrance examination widely adopted by Brazilian universities, which poses challenging tasks for LMs since its questions may span multiple fields of knowledge, requiring understanding of information from diverse domains.

The paper analyzes responses generated by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models for questions presented in the 2009-2017 exams, as well as for questions of the 2022 exam, which were made public after the training of the models completed. Furthermore, different prompt strategies were tested, including the use of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts to generate explanations to answers.

On the 2022 edition, the best-performing model, GPT-4 with CoT, achieved an accuracy of 87%, largely surpassing GPT-3.5 by 11 points.

## Data

We made available the [ENEM-2022 dataset](data/enem/2022.json), created by parsing questions and alternatives from the latest edition of the ENEM test. The dataset was structured and annotated with tags indicating the domain:

- TU - Text Understanding
- IU - Image Understanding
- MR - Mathematical Reasoning
- ML - Multilanguage
